# Hangman Game
<sup>Hangman Game Using Java</sup>

🖥️ Prelim Task Performance for my 3rd-year college course **"Programming Languages."**

This is a simple Java console word-guessing game where the players tries to guess a **'K-POP goup name'** which is a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The player has 6 attempts before the game ends.
